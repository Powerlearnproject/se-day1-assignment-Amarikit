Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    Software engineering entails the application of engineering principles,methods and tools in the development and maintainance of high quality software systems.
    In the technology industry it enables creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life like communication and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
   -Development of programming languages like Fortran
   -the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s
   -advent of structured programming in the 1970s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   The phases of software development include;
   -Requirements - Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
   -Design -Creating high level and detailed designsof software architecture and user interface.
   -Implementation - Writing of the code and building the design
   -Testing - use of tests to ensure the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements.
   -Deployment - the release of software to users.
   -maintainance - Provision of ongoing support,updates and enhancements after the product has been deployed. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases while the agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility,collaboration.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
      Software developer- Responsible for writing codes and implementing software.
      Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures software quality by designing and executing tests
      Project Manager - oversees the planning,execution, and delivery of software projects. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
     these software development tools enhance productivity and the overall quality.
    Integrated development Environments provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. example of IDEs is visual studio
    Version Control system  help in the tracking of code changes  and coordinating work among team members . Example is git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    -challenges include requirements that change during the development process, tight deadlines and technical debt.
    strategies to overcome include effective communication , agile methodologies and prioritization of tasks

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   - Unit testing tests the individual components or modules of software
   - Intergration testibng tests the interaction between different components.
   - System testing tests the entire system as a whole
   - Acceptance testing tests the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Testing helps in earlty identification and fixation of defects in the development process resulting in high quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
   Prompt engineering is the use of instructions or commands (prompts) to obtain specific response from AI.
   Importance is that it helps in development of prompts that enable one obtain better responses from AI.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- Tell me about life?
improved one - What makes life interesting when it comes to how we view our relations with our environment and people?
The improved prompt is more clear and specific.
